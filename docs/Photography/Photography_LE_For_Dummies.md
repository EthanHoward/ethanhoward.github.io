# Photography - Long Exposure for Dummies

Long exposure is a specific method used in photography to achieve some rather unique looks.

If you've read the exposure page, or generally understand the concept of exposure, you'll notice 'long' likely refers to the shutter speed used. When we do long exposure, we shoot with the shutter speed a lot slower than you'd typically use (obviously other settings like ISO and Aperture are lowered to allow the correct exposure).

If you've ever seen those photos where the lights of cars (or anything moving) leave trails, then you've seen a photograph (likely) taken with long exposure. [Here's](https://lightroom.adobe.com/learn/discover/da22298c-4828-4d2d-a66c-6d87b9ea7c13) one I've done.

The absolute easiest way, with minimal kit, of doing a long exposure photograph is at night near a road, you will likely need a tripod or some way to mount your camera / steady it. This kind-of photography cannot be done handheld (if your camera has insanely good IBIS, you might be able to get to 1/30th seconds while handheld, like [this, crappy, handheld one](https://lightroom.adobe.com/learn/discover/6243b337-f6f9-4e41-b8c1-99bce9cdf945) by me.). 

Now the concept behind long exposure is that everything that doesn't move will be sharp, and everything moving won't (if you shutter speed is long enough). This compounds at night because everything both dark and in-motion will be practically invisible, whereas bright and moving things, such as car lights, will expose wherever they move at a much higher rate, leaving trails.

Remembering the rules of composure here will make your images much better, especially with leading lines in this kind of scene, especially with roads, getting a good road which either curves at the end, or has a good s-bend will make a really nice photo. Generally a road with a good vanishing point makes much better long exposure road photo. 

Dropping your ISO down, to lower settings, like 80 or 100 (or whatever is the native ISO of your camera) and setting your shutter to 15" (seconds) or so, will give you (probably) an overexposed image, then adjust your aperture. Now if at this point, you're going over, say, f/14 in your aperture, you probably don't want to do that as it can negatively effect image quality, instead, shorten (decrease) your shutter speed down to 10" (seconds) or something.

Just play around with this one and experiment with your settings, if you're doing a really busy road, you don't need a long shutter to get a car which goes across your whole frame, if it's a really quiet or slow road, you need that longer shutter me.

Remembering to have your petal cover (yeah, I did indeed say petal cover, at night) is very important if shooting under street lamps or other stationary light sources as they can cause parts of your image to become washed out (loss of colour and/or contrast). If you looked at the first image I linked, [this](https://lightroom.adobe.com/learn/discover/da22298c-4828-4d2d-a66c-6d87b9ea7c13) one, you'll notice the top right of the frame looks a bit yucky, that's because just off frame there is a street lamp, which cast light at a high incident angle into my lens, causing coma and that 'foggy' effect on the frame. That's after my failed attempt at fixing it, mind you. 

So, summary, general rules of long exposure:
- Stationary Camera
- Petal Cover if under street light.
- Long Shutter Time (Slow Shutter Speed)
- Low ISO
- Tight Aperture (High F/number, but not more than f/14-16)

These photos can be done in daytime however you MAY need an ND filter. (N)eutral (D)ensity filters are a filter which, equally across all wavelengths, reduces emission / intensity. For normal people, they're sunglasses for your camera. You can get Fixed ND filters, referred to simply as ND filters, and you can get VND filters, which are (V)ariable ND filters. Alternatively, if you own two Circular Polarizer Filters / Polarizer Filters, you can combine them at various rotations to get a similar effect, although cheaper ones do sometimes cause a deep blue or purple colour cast, or uneven dimming across the frame.

Typically, for the photos of rivers and waterfalls where they look like glass or like mist, the photographer will use an ND filter. I rely on the K&F Concept 100mm Square Filter holder and two different NDs, I will link to them below.

- [Holder](https://amzn.eu/d/0190EdLD)
- [ND64](https://amzn.eu/d/04XuquK6)
- [ND1000](https://amzn.eu/d/070aAMuz)

Generally you won't need any more options than these three. The benefit of a system like this is that the holder attaches to an intermediary ring, allowing many different lens thread diameters to work, allowing you to work with literally 95% of lenses that you'd ever use for this kind of photography. 

The static ND's are good but if you're working with a lot of different light levels or simply don't want the pain of swapping the filters, go for a circular variable ND filter, they are easier to use in my opinion but sometimes can be quite expensive upfront.
