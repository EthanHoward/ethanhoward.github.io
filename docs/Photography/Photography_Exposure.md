# Photography - Exposure

Exposure can be one of the hardest things for new photographers to nail down, once you get that initial break, and it all starts to make sense, it becomes so very easy. Once you get exposure nailed, you still will mess it up, and sometimes it'll ruin that one irreplaceable scene or frame, and other times it might make one of your best pieces to-date, that's the art in photography.

You should aim to, if possible, get the photograph 90% of the way there while you're taking it. Then the editing is minimal. Unless of-course, you intend to do more heavy methods of manipulation, then that's less important.

Oh, and one thing to live by in photography. Nothing is 'Right' or 'Wrong', there are 'best practices' but that's the thing, they're the 'best', not THE practices. Throw them out of the window when you feel like it, and it could make you a good artist, not just some dummy with a camera. Saying all that, if you do something like grossly under or over exposing an image (creating some solid black or solid white frame) - and calling it 'art' I might vomit.

## Exposure - What is it really referring to?

Exposure broadly refers to the amount of light that hits a light sensitive media. Such as film, light-sensitive paper, glass-plate photography and the most common form, digital sensors.

In photography, we control the exposure, to get the intended image, there are three main parts to exposure when we talk about film and digital sensors, the third is less applicable to glass-plate photography or paper-based media.

Digital and Analogue Film cameras function with three parameters, ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed.

### ISO

ISO is named peculiarly as it is actually named after the International Standards Organisation as they created the standard for measuring, at the time, film sensitivity.

In film ISO is simply a way to tell how sensitive a roll of film is, as the ISO number increases the grain size gets larger while the dynamic range (explained later) decreases. This can't be changed on film, you buy film at 'X' ISO number, and you're stuck with it, you have to just work with it.

Some films do handle higher ISO well, however, I am not particularly educated on film photography.

In digital, it functions more like a gain to apply to the sensor. We can change it as we see fit, there are consequences though. As the ISO number increases on a digital camera, the dynamic range decreases and the noise becomes much more noticeable, noting that grain size increasing does not occur on digital sensors, that only occurs on film as film doesn't behave the same way as digital imagery and in-fact does have some form of resolution which is fundamentally different to that of digital images, film does not have a pixel grid like digital imagery does.

Digital sensors, instead of grain, have noise, which is the mis-colouring or mis-exposing (essentially 'error') of a single pixel.

### Aperture

Aperture (f-stop or f/&lt;number&gt;) is a calculation based on the lens diameter and the focal length of a given optic. That's at least the maths-heavy definition, below is more how most photographers need to understand it.

Aperture controls both the amount of light and the angle of the rays which can enter and hit the sensor (or film!). It is, in most lenses, variable from a 'wide' (low) number (ex. f/2) to a 'tighter' (bigger) number (ex. f/22).

Generally the sharpest apertures are in the ranges f/8-f/14 on most lenses, although this isn't gospel, its generally in the middle of the minimum and maximum apertures. Noting that minimum and maximum here are actually flipped (I know, stupid), minimum referring to the highest f-stop and tightest pupil (where the 'minimum' bit comes from).

##### Tight Aperture / High f-stop / High f/number ?

A Higher f-stop causes a smaller hole in the pupil, which causes less light to hit the sensor which also causes the light rays to be more parallel (not perfectly parallel!) to one another and thus perpendicular to the sensor (or film!).

Parallel rays cause a larger depth of field (more stuff can be in focus at one point) and also a weaker bokeh, which is a blur that resides either side of the in-focus DOF.

So essentially bokeh is the out-of-focus part of a scene and can be used artistically to achieve really beautiful effects (The word's Japanese).

When the aperture gets toward its highest f-stop, it can experience diffraction and other artifacts, which is why you typically don't push it as far as possible, and why people use ND filters for brighter areas and/or for works such as long exposure (see that on the long exposure page).

#### Wide Aperture / Low f-stop / Low f/number ?

The lower the f-stop (the aperture), the pupil (hole) get wider which, in turn, allows more light in and also allows light at a more skew angle (further from 90°) in.

This lets you expose the sensor (or film!) for less time or at a lower ISO, or both, compared to when you're at a higher aperture.

The light being allowed in at a more oblique (fancy talk for skew) angle causes a shallower DoF, so a shallower focused region, and the blur on either side of it is more pronounced.

At a lower aperture you can experience a much more noticeable coma (artifact) in the image, many lenses experience stronger vignetting and many other artifacts. Thankfully, modern optics are incredibly good at accounting for, and correcting these various artifacts. Software also has very clever ways of sorting it out - to an extent.

### Shutter Speed

Shutter speed is the time the sensor (or film!) is exposed to light for, in most cameras there's a physical curtain which opens and lets light in for a set duration, now there's a lot of content in just the different types of shutters, maybe I will ramble on about it some time, but for now, ignore it generally. Some cameras do not have a physical shutter mechanism at all and function by electronic shutter, I will explain that somewhere else, as I said, there's a lot in shutter types.

On a camera it is displayed in various formats, for now, I will show you two of them, these are more relevant to Nikon (as that's what I shoot on) however most cameras do the same.

Shutter speeds faster than a second are displayed as a fraction, 1/&lt;number&gt;. Let us take 1/1000th for example, that is 1 second / 1000, which gives us 1 millisecond (0.001 seconds!) of exposure time.
One sidenote, some cameras do not show the fraction everywhere, for example, my Nikon Z cameras won't show 1/ before a sub-second exposure on the top small display but still displays it in the electronic viewfinder and on the back display, this is typical of modern cameras.

<!-- @IGNORE:COMMA_PARENTHESIS_WHITESPACE@ -->
Shutter speeds slower than a second are typically displayed as a number by itself or suffixed by " (which refers to seconds). For example, 30" refers to 30 seconds. Easy right?

<!-- @IGNORE:EN_UNPAIRED_QUOTES@ -->
For some cameras they MAY display in minutes for longer exposures with '. Can't say I've seen it, but it likely happens somewhere, probably on older film cameras.

### How light behaves

The reason I mention the behaviours of light rays is because it really helped me to understand the "why" behind bokeh and DoF. (explained later)

Light rays are, well, a ray, they have a polarization (mostly irrelevant however applies with more specialised photography) and a direction they're moving, light bounces off everything we see, bearing in mind what we're seeing is reflected light, not the 'thing' our brain is compositing into imagery.

Light rays can bounce off everything in a scene and that causes those rays to have varied directions of movement, which means when light rays enter the end of your lens, they could be moving straight at the sensor (90° / Perpendicular to the sensor) or even moving at an angle where it only JUST makes it in the lens and through the iris (aperture).

Bokeh is related to the amount of non-parallel rays you have, therefore, a wider aperture gives you MORE bokeh.

Another behaviour of light is characterised by the Inverse-Square Law (thanks, Einstein!). It states that as the distance from a light source increases, the light intensity at any given point decreases. 

Although the Inverse-Square Law is designed in reference to point-source in free space (I'm not a physicist, google it!), it is not wrong about photography, just not technically, perfectly, accurate.

And that is why you move your torch closer to stuff when it is too dark.

### Hard versus Soft Light

Hard And Soft light are names for a specific setting you're working in.

#### Hard light
This broadly refers to a type of undiffused light, it leaves sharp edges and makes your images have a lot of contrast - which sometimes you may want, but typically not so. A good example of when you're highly likely to experience hard light is outside, under direct sunlight in the summer, as the light is emitted from a point-source (the sun, duh!) there's not much variation on where the rays are coming from, and going to, meaning edges are much more pronounced.

It can be very destructive to your photographs, however, I have seen some really impressive images of architecture taken under some form of hard light, the emphasis of the angular edges of a building can cause a lot of very appealing parts to an image, and generally make composing a much easier task.

#### Soft light
This refers to diffused light, essentially the opposite characteristics to hard light. An example of where you might experience this is outside under an overcast sky because the cloud-cover essentially functions as one rather large diffuser, making all the light softer. This is due to the light rays from the sun hitting the clouds and bouncing around, getting all jumbled up, and emitting from the bottom of the clouds.

This can, once again, make or break an image, it is great for documentary imagery and for less striking images, but fails to look nice when used, say, for architecture. 

### The exposure triangle?

The exposure triangle refers to a combination of the three 'dials', ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed.

When you push one high, the other two can be lowered, when you push two high, one must be very low and when you push all three high... you get a white screen. And, as you'd guess, when you push all three low, you get a black frame.

Lower exposure and under-exposure and under-exposed all refer to an image which is too dark (in some subjective quantity).

The opposite can be said for higher exposure, over-exposure and over-exposed, which is where an image is too bright.

'Blown Out' refers to a part of a scene which is grossly overexposed, the camera typically registers these areas as white, with no texture, just a white blob. 'Blown Out' parts are typically avoidable but, sometimes you just have to live with them.

On most modern cameras you have exposure compensation. I haven't ever used it, however it can be used to, when in a semi-automatic (Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority) shooting mode, tell the camera to intentionally under or over expose (based on your metering settings).


### Metering?
Metering generally refers to determining the light levels in a scene and what is 'right'. Most cameras have a scale, it is typically visible on your back screen or inside your viewfinder, or both, it'll have two ends with arrows and will show like a form of a number-line, one end '+' and one end '-'. This then has a line showing you where your exposure sits. Correct exposure (determined by the camera's algorithms) is in the dead centre of that.

Most, if not all, cameras have a metering setting to tell the camera what parts of the scene to evaluate (In Nikon Cameras it is titled 'Metering'), most have options like:
- Centre-Weighted Metering (Focuses on the centre region of the frame)
- Spot-Weighted Metering (Tighter region than Centre-Weighted, good for stuff like wildlife photography)
- Matrix Metering (The whole frame, good when you are photographing a scene which doesn't have a specific pronounced subject)
- Highlight-Weighted Metering (The exposure is based on the brightest part of the scene, it tries to get those so they're correctly exposed, not 'blown out')

Importantly, you should look at this often to tell how you're exposed, before long, you will be able to look at the frame and determine, based on look, if it is exposed to your taste.

Some problems arise when using metering options like SPOT or Highlight. If you're using SPOT and you are pointing at something which is just black, the camera doesn't know that, so it will try its hardest to max out its settings and get some texture there, this is especially an issue with painted, reflective things like Cars. The opposite can be said for Highlight, if you're in, say, Santorini, Greece, where all the buildings are painted brilliant white, with those blue domes, and you're using Highlight, your camera will go ballistic, trying to under-expose the image to get detail on those white buildings. It will struggle to do that, and the rest of your scene will almost certainly be grossly underexposed.

### Dynamic Range

Dynamic range refers to the distance between the darkest and lightest parts of your image which have detail (importantly, parts which have detail, not just black and white blocks).

When your dynamic range is LOW, your image might appear to have a lower contrast (for ease, we can call it LDR), and vice versa for HIGH dynamic range (HDR!).

Capturing HDR is harder than LDR as in a low dynamic range scene, your camera will almost certainly have a wider dynamic range in the sensor, to capture that whole scene. Whereas, in an HDR scene, the 'distance' between the darkest detailed part and the brightest detailed part is almost always outside the capabilities of a camera sensor, which means you'll lose either some of the shadows or some of the highlights, you're forced to pick (Not all cameras struggle with this, some can capture HDR-In body and in only one shot).

LDR images will likely benefit from some adjustment of light levels, contrast and curves to increase the perceived dynamic range.

Please note that Contrast and Dynamic Range are NOT proportionate, you can have a Low Contrast HDR scene.

Most cameras these days can do HDR imagery in-body but require a tripod or a support, where it can take three or more photographs of different exposure levels, to combine to one nicely exposed image which is also HDR. Typically referred to either as Exposure Bracketing. There's also ways to manually bracket your photos (take a few underexposed, one or two correct and a few overexposed) and combine them in post-processing too, Lightroom can do it.
