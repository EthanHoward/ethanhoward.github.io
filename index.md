Welcome to my knowledgebase, full of many-a-different genre of material, stuff I'd probably forget if I didn't write it down somewhere. 

This isn't written as some formal piece of work, it is written how i would like to read it, what makes sense the most. So if there's some poorly formed sentence, boohoo, none of this is intended for public speaking anyways :D.

Nothing really important here, check out the other pages!

Still a big Ol' WIP thing so mind it being a little rough around the edges, I'm quite new to using this Jekyll stuff.
